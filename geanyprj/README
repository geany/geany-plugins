About
=====

geanyprj is alternative project manager for Geany fast light IDE.

Why it was created?
-------------------

Open source is great, there are a lot of nice sources that you can use for your projects
in Internet. But there are also a lot of crappy sources and when you want steal something
you need to check if it is good or not. Ability to jump to definition/declaration and back is
great help for such task. But no other text editor or IDE I know allow this without a lot of setuping.
You have to create/import project add files. When you finish with one project
you need to close it and repeat procedure for all other. Great time wasting. If you are checking
about 10 potential places you want steal code from, you won't create any project and don't
get "jump to definition/declaration" just because it is too much bother.

geanyprj aims to provide "jump to definition/declaration" functions with as little setup as possible.

Why different project manager, why don't improve existing code in Geany?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's because current project manager in Genny more about sessions. It is not something real
project manager should do (IMHO). It allow/require user manually open/close project and allow
to store project files in different locations from project sources.

geanyprj takes different approach:

1) Never save session information (this way project files can be stored in version control without
constant noise from changes of opened files or cursor position)

2) Never open/close project manually. If .geanyprj file is found somewhere up in path it will be
opened automatically.

Usage
=====

geanyprj add "Tools->Project" menu and sidebar "Project" tab.

Project properties
------------------

Name - This is just project name you will see it in status window on open/close project.

Location - This is directory where .geanyprj file will be saved.

Base Path - If defined Geany will use this directory as current directory for make and run commands

Generate file list on load - This option tell Geany to recreate project file list on project load using
selected type. If it is unchecked you should manually select files you want to be parsed by tagmanager.

Type - This is type of files that needed to be parsed by tagmanager.

 * All - All files that is known to Geany
 * C/C++ - This match any C or C++ files (.c, .cpp, .cxx, .h etc.)
 * C - This match only C files  (.c, .h)
 * Python - This match python files (.py)
 * None - This doesn't match any files


Example of usage
----------------

Lets see plugin work at Geany source code example:

1) Download geany-0.15.tar.gz (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/geany/geany-0.15.tar.gz?download)

2) Unpack it somewhere, for example in ~/src/geany-0.15

3) Open ~/src/geany-0.15/configure.in

4) Click "Tools->Project->New Project", and click "Create" button

 This will create and save .geanyprj file in ~/src/geany-0.15. From now, every time you
 open file from ~/src/geany-0.15 dirrectory or it's subdirrectory .geanyprj will be opened.
 So next time you don't have to create or open project manually.

5) Open any geany source code code file

 "go to tag declaration/definition" should work for any geany function. (Not limited to opened files).

6) Now you open file that doesn't belong to Geany. For example ~/src/myprj/a.c Geany project will be closed. If ~/src/myprj/.geanyprj exists it will be opened as current project.

7) Switching back to any Geany file will open Geany project again.
