About
=====

The Workbench plugin is an extension that makes it possible to manage
multiple projects in geany. You can add geany projects to a workbench.
From there you can add directories to the project to manage the files
belonging to the project.

Usage
=====

Enabling the plugin
-------------------
The plugin can be enabled in the plugin manager. After enabling the plugin
a new tab will be displayed in the Sidebar. There will also be a new entry
in the menubar. Both are labeled "Workbench".

The Workbench menu
------------------
The Workbench menu is the starting point for creating your first workbench.
Choose "New" from the menu to create your workbench file. Workbench files
use the prefix ".geanywb". Just like Geany project files they are also
simple text files containing key-value pairs.

The complete managment of the Workbench file is done using the Workbench
menu:
- Item "New": as explained above, creates a new Workbench
- Item "Open": open a Workbench
- Item "Save": save the opened Workbench. This "only" saves any changes
  in the Workbench file. It does not save any changes of the projects
  belonging to the Workbench.
- Item "Settings": open the Workbench settings dialog.
- Item "Close": closes the opened Workbench.

The new Workbench
-----------------
A newly created Workbench is completely empty. In the Workbench tab of
the sidebar you should see the hint "Add a project using the context
menu". Anything which is dealing with projects and their Workbench
related settings is done using the context menu on the sidebar. Some
items in the context menu will only be active if you right click inside
a project, directory or bookmark.

The Workbench context menu:
---------------------------

These are the available items:

- "Add project":
  Add an existing Geany project to the Workbench. Create your projects
  with Geany. The Workbench plugin does not help you with that. After
  adding a project you need to save the workbench settings by selecting
  "Workbench / Save" in the menubar.
- "Save project":
  Selecting this item will save the Workbench related project settings in
  the Geany project file. It is only available if you right clicked inside
