/*
  Simply put, the GDB/MI output is parsed into one of three types:
  anything inside quotes is a string; anything inside curly brackets
  is a hash table; and anything inside square braces is a list.
  In some cases list elements are produced by GDB as key-value pairs
  with duplicate key names for each element. For these cases the
  key names are safely and silently ignored, only the values are kept.
