GeniusPaste Plugin
==================

.. contents::

About
-----
This plugin allows the user to paste the code from Geany into five different
pastebins. At the moment it supports this services:

	* codepad.org
	* tinypaste.com
	* pastebin.geany.org
	* dpaste.de
	* sprunge.us

GeniusPaste detects automatically the syntax of the code and paste it
with syntax highlighting enabled.
It can also display the pasted code opening a new browser tab.

Issues
------
The API of the pastebin services can be updated in every moment. It
may happen that GeniusPaste plugin could use an outdated API that meanwhile
has been deprecated.

If you get a unexpected API response during the paste process (practically
if the plugin doesn't return a link to the pasted code) write a email to me
and warn me about the changes:
