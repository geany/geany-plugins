About
=====

MultiTerm is similar to Geany's built-in VTE terminal except that it
supports multiple terminals in tabs and supports different shells in
each of the terminal tabs.


Requirements
============

MultiTerm depends on the very common VTE library (libvte).  In order
to compile the MultiTerm plugin you will need the development files for
the VTE library.

MultiTerm is written in Vala and so requires that you have the Vala
compiler (valac) installed if you're compiling from Git, as well as your
existing C compiler. If you're compiling from a source release, the Vala
compiler is not required as the generated sources are distributed with the
release.


Compiling and Installing
========================

For detailed instructions, see the README and/or INSTALL files of the
Geany-Plugins package this plugin is part of.

Note that when compiling MultiTerm, the C code that the Vala compiler
generates triggers a few C compiler warnings in most configurations. These
warnings are (almost always) harmless, and are outside of our control.
There's a bug open with the Vala compiler working on fixing this:

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=732531

If you want to hide these warnings, add the appropriate `-Wno-XXX` compiler
flags to the ``MULTITERM_CFLAGS`` environment variable when configuring the
build.


Usage
=====

The MultiTerm plugin adds a new tab to the message area which contains the
notebook for the Terminals.  You can add terminals by clicking on the plus
button to the right of the tabs and you can close terminals by clicking the
tab's close button.

The configuration file is stored at
`~/.config/geany/plugins/multiterm/multiterm.conf` and can be tweaked to
change the behaviour of the plugin.  Eventually there will be a GUI to
control the preferences, but for now it's just this file.

Note that for the time being, the configuration file will not be backwards
compatible, so you should transfer your settings to a new default
configuration file whenever installing a new version. Moving the old config
file out of the way will cause a new compatible default config file to be
written in its place.
