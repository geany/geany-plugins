About
=====

MultiTerm is similar to Geany's built-in VTE terminal except that it
supports multiple terminals in tabs and supports different shells in
each of the terminal tabs.


Requirements
============

MultiTerm depends on the very common VTE library (libvte).  In order
to compile the MultiTerm plugin you will need the development files for
the VTE library.

MultiTerm is written in Vala and so requires that you have the Vala
compiler (valac) installed as well as your existing C compiler.


Installation
============

For detailed instructions, see the INSTALL file of the Geany-Plugins package
this plugin is part of.


Usage
=====

While the user-interface of the plugin will soon be completely revamped,
at present it adds a new tab to the message area which contains the
notebook for the Terminals.  You can add terminals by clicking on the
plus button to the right of the tabs and you can close terminals by
clicking the tab's close button.

The configuration file is also going to change a fair bit soon, but
it is stored at `~/.config/geany/plugins/multiterm/multiterm.conf` and
can be tweaked to change the behaviour of the plugin.  Eventually there
will be a GUI to control the preferences, but for now it's just this
file.

Note that until at least the first release of the MultiTerm plugin the
configuration file will not be backwards-compatible, so you should
transfer your settings to a new default configuration file whenever
rebuilding from source.  Moving the old config file out of the way will
cause a new default config file to be written in its place.
