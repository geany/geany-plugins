# MultiTerm Configuration File                                                 #

#                                                                              #
# You can configure the behaviour of the MultiTerm plugin by adjusting the     #
# values in this file.  Lines begining with a # are considered comments and    #
# are left as is.  Group/section names go in [] and keys and values are        #
# separated by an = symbol.  Where more than one value can be supplied, as in  #
# a list, separate the values with the ; symbol.                               #
#                                                                              #
# Groups/section names begining with 'shell=' denote a type of terminal/shell  #
# that can be opened.  The name of the shell follows the = symbol.             #
# Each shell can have it's own specific VTE configuration and can run it's own #
# child command.  As an example, if you wanted to use the Python interpreter   #
# shell instead of the default shell, specify 'command=python'.                #
#                                                                              #
# Keys/values commented out or empty values will cause MultiTerm to use        #
# default values.                                                              #
