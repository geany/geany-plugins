  - Add right-click menu to VTE
  - Add GUI for preferences
  - Make tabs not fill entire space available
  - Add a terminal-specific right-click menu to each tab
  - Support sending editor selection to active (or specific) terminal
  - Get plugin building with Waf build system
  - When no user config file is present copy
    `DATADIR/geany-plugins/multiterm/multiterm.conf` to the user's
    config dir to make a default config file.  Currently the default
    config is hardcoded.
  - Support having the main tab be in the sidebar as well as the
    message window.
