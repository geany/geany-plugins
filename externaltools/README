External Tools
==============

About
-----
This plugin provides a way to quickly launch external tools (i.e. non-geany
tools) in the same context as a document. For example, this may include
starting a terminal or a file manager in the same directory as the current
file.

Supported tools
---------------
The tools currently supported include:

1. Open Terminal: This option launches a terminal in the same directory as the
current document.

2. Open Directory: Launches a file manager, in the same directory as the
current document.

They may be launched from the *Tools* menu, or via a shortcut.

Configuration
-------------
In the plugin's preferences you can adjust the command used to spawn each
tool. Occurrences of `%f` in the provided commands are substituted with the
path to the current file, while `%d` is substituted with the path to the
directory in which the file resides.

If the current document is *untitled*, %d is replaced with the home directory,
while %f is effectively erased.

**Tip:** Some file managers support opening a window at a directory *and*
placing focus on a specific file. Examples: `nemo %f`, `nautilus %f`, `dolphin
--select %f`.

Adding new tools
----------------
At the moment, adding new tools requires modifying the plugin's source, though
the code is structured in a way to easily accommodate this.

Bug reports, suggestions, patches
---------------------------------
You can report bugs, or suggest new tools or other improvements at the
geany-plugins project on GitHub: https://github.com/geany/geany-plugins. You
may page the developer using `@gkatev`.
