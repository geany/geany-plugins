About
------

GeanySendMail is a little plugin to send a document as attachment
using the preferred mail client from inside Geany. It is similar to
the envelope symbol of most office tools and requires a mail client
that is supporting remote calls.


Requirements
------------

For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.8.0)
libraries and header files. You will also need its dependency
libraries and header files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these
files are available at http://www.gtk.org.

And obviously, you will need to have Geany installed. If you have Geany
installed from the sources, you should be ready to go. If you used a
prepared package e.g. from your distribution you probably need to
install an additional package, this might be called geany-dev or
geany-devel. Please note that in order to compile and use this plugin,
you need Geany 0.20 or later (Geany Plugin API v199 or higher).

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool. The
GNU versions of these tools are recommended.


Installation
------------

This version of the plugin is installed with the combined
geany-plugins release. Please check README of this package or download
stand alone version of plugin from
http://frank.uvena.de/en/Geany/geanysendmail/


Usage
-----

After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin
manager and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear. Before you
can start you need to configure your mail client. This can be done in
the configuration dialog (details on it later). You can also assign a
keyboard shortcut in Geany's preferences dialog to send your document.


Configuration
-------------

In the configuration dialog you can set up a command that is called by
the plugin to communicate with your mail client. Depending on what's
your favorite mailer, the command will differ. A number of
placeholders are available for doing this:

* %s: Will be replaced by the complete path of the file that should be send.
* %r: Will be replaced by one or more recipient's email address that can be
      entered inside a separate dialog. (Please remember during input, what your
      mail client is expecting here)
* %b: Will be replace by the file name. For a file /tmp/foo.baa it will be
      replaced by foo.baa.

Depending on how you like to use, you can combine all of the
placeholders to build up your command. It is possible to use one
placeholder several times. When using keep care, as the placeholders
are replace step by step, so a filename containing %b might have some
funny outcome. However, examples could be:

Sylpheed:
	sylpheed --attach "%f" --compose "%r"
mutt:
	mutt -s "Sending '%b'" -a "%f" "%r"
Mozilla Thunderbird at Windows:
	"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe" \
		-compose to="%r",subject="%b",attachment="%f"

In theory it should also work together with tools like Microsoft
Outlook - Unfortunately the author wasn't able to bring it up
running. Input for the correct commandline is highly welcome.


Development
-----------

You can checkout the current source code from the Subversion
repository at Sourceforge.net. Get the code from:

svn checkout
http://geany-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geany-plugins/trunk/geanysendmail

As this plugin is part of the combined geany-plugins release, you may
also like to check its Subversion repository by checking ou

svn checkout
http://geany-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geany-plugins/trunk/geany-plugins/


If you want to create a patch, please respect the license of
GeanySendMail (GPLv2 or above) as well as intellectual property of
third. Patches that should be included to the default distribution
must be licensed under the same conditions as GeanySendMail by the
copyright owner.


Known issues
------------

In case you are working with white spaces either in your path names,
file names or at mail addresses (e.g. for separating two addresses)
you should keep care of proper quoting since %s, %b and %r will be
replaced without any quotes.
