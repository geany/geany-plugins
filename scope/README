Scope Plugin
============

About
-----
Scope is a graphical GDB front-end with the normal functions you would
expect (stepping, breakpoints...), and a few notable features:

- The comminication between Scope and gdb is asynchronous.
- You can enter any gdb command, at any time (of course, for the command to
  be executed, gdb must be[come] available).
- All gdb I/O (along with some other messages) is displayed in a
  terminal-like "Debug Console".
  Whenever you find the GUI lacking, simply switch to that console and work
  directly with gdb.
- 7-bit/Locale/UTF-8 support for values.
