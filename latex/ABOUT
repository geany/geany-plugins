It implements a couple of maybe useful functions:

	*  Wizard to create new LaTeX documents in a fast and easy way
	   with a bunch of templates available
	*  A front end for add labels \label{} and references \ref{} and 
	   \pageref{} with getting suggestion from aux file of document
	*  Inserting special characters through menu
	*  Help entering the right fields for BibTeX entries by
	   providing templates
	*  Easy inserting format patterns like \texttt{} through menu
	*  Support on inserting environments by offering an dialog and
	   recognising selections
	*  Shortcuts for inserting \item and \newline
