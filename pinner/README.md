# Pinner

Pinner is a [geany plugin](https://www.geany.org/support/plugins/) that
enables pinning documents to a sidebar tab.

This will add two items to the Geany tools menu:

    Pin Document
    Unpin Document

To clear the list, Right click on it and left-click on "Clear".

## Keybindings

When the plugin is enabled, keybindings to pin and unpin documents can be
changed from the preferences menu.
