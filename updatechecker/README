About
------

UpdateChecker is a plugin for Geany, which is able to check whether
there is a more recent version of Geany available.


Installation
------------

This version of the plugin is installed with the combined
geany-plugins release. Please check README of this package
and/or https://plugins.geany.org/install.html.


Usage
-----

After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear.

When pushing the entry inside the menu bar, the plugin will try to
get in contact with the Geany-servers and figure out, whether there
has been a new version release or not. Once there is some result,
you will get informed by a info popup.

In default configuration the plugin will not check automatically for new
versions. But you can change this by activating this in the
configuration dialog. Once a new version of Geany is released, this
feature will create a popup until you have updated Geany and its
plugins. This has potential to plague you with Geany's new version.

Requirements
------------

Updatechecker depends on a recent version of Geany (0.20 or above)
as well as on:

* GTK >= 3.0
* libsoup 3

To compile it on your own you will need the devel packages for these.


Development
-----------

You can checkout the current source code from the git repository at
github.com. Get the code by:

git clone https://github.com/geany/geany-plugins.git
