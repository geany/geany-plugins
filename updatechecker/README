About
------

UpdateChecker is a plugin for Geany, which is able to check whether
there is a more recent version of Geany available.


Installation
------------

This version of the plugin is installed with the combined
geany-plugins release. Please check README of this package


Usage
-----

After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear.

When pushing the entry inside the menu bar, the plugin will try to
get in contact with the Geany-servers and figure out, whether there
has been a new version release or not. Once there is some result,
you will get informed by a info popup.

In default configuration the plugin will not check automaticly for
new versions. But you can change this by activating this inside
configuration dialog.


Requirements
------------

Updatechecker depends on a recent version of Geany (0.20 or above)
as well as on:

* GTK >= 2.12
* libsoup 2.4 >= 2.4.0

To compile it on your own you will need the devel packages for these.
