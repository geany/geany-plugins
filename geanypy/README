GeanyPy
=======

Write Geany plugins in Python!

Provides most of the standard Geany C API for Python.

**Please note:** GeanyPy here in geany-plugins is based on the upstream 
at https://github.com/codebrainz/geanypy which is still under 
development, however it is useful as is.  Parts of the existing API 
which mirror the Geany C API will probably not change unless the Geany API 
changes, however new API may be added.  Also documentation is needed, 
contributions are welcome.

How it works
------------

In the ``src/`` directory is a normal Geany plugin (``plugin.c``) which loads the
Python interpreter.  It then loads some C Python modules (``dialogs.c``,
``documents.c``, etc.) that interface with Geany's C API.  After that, it loads
the ``geany`` Python module which is just glue/sugar-coating to make the C
module more "Pythonic".

To write a plugin, inherit from the ``geany.Plugin`` class and implmenent the
required members (see ``geany/plugin.py`` documentation comments).  Then put the
plugin in a searched plugin path.  Currently two locations are search for
plugins.  The first is ``PREFIX/share/geany/geanypy/plugins`` and the recommended
location is under your personal Geany directory (usually
``~/.config/geany/plugins/geanypy/plugins``).  To load or unload plugins, click
the Python Plugin Manager item under the Tools menu which will appear when you
activate GeanyPy through Geany's regular plugin manager.

When the GeanyPy plugin is loaded, it has an option to add a new tab to 
the notebook in the message window area that contains an interactive 
Python shell with the ``geany`` module pre-imported.  You can tinker 
around with API with this console, for example::


    import geany
    
    doc = geany.document.open_file("/some/file/here")
    
    print(doc.file_name)
    print(doc.file_type.display_name)
    
    geany.dialogs.show_msgbox("Hello World")
    
    geany.main_widgets.window.set_title("Hello Window")
    
    def on_document_open(doc):
        print("Document '%s' was opened" % doc.file_name)
    
    geany.signals.connect('document-open', on_document_open)
    

Dependencies
------------

To build GeanyPy you need the following dependencies:

* Python 2.6 or 2.7 and development files.
* Geany 1.24+ and development files
* PyGTK 2.0 and development files
