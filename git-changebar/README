About
=====

This plugin highlights uncommitted changes to files tracked with Git,
allows to navigate through the hunks and undo them.


Requirements
============

This plugin depends on libgit2, and obviously Geany (>= 1.25).


Installation
============

For detailed instructions, see the INSTALL file of the Geany-Plugins package
this plugin is part of.


Usage
=====

When loaded into Geany, this plugins adds markers in the markers margin.
If the marker margin is not visible, they are displayed as line backgrounds.

When you point your mouse on a marker that indicates a changed or removed hunk,
a tooltip pops up showing the original contents of that hunk.

To navigate through the hunks of the current file, you need to configure the
plugin's *Go to next hunk* and *Go to previous hunk* keybindings in Geany's
preferences dialog.

Hunks can also be undone by either setting a cursor at a line with a hunk and
invoking the *Undo hunk at the cursor position* or by right-clicking in the
editor where the hunk is located and selecting *Undo Git hunk* from the popup
menu.
