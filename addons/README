About
-----

This plugin adds various small addons to Geany which aren't worth an own
plugin but might still useful for people.

Features
--------

* Toolbar button with a list of open files
* Open and Copy URI found in a document command
* Task list in a message window
* Bookmark list in a sidebar
* Status icon in the notification area
* Highlighting all occurrences of a word when double-clicking it
* Strip trailing blank lines when saving
* XMLtagging
* Enclose selected text with characters
* Show colorized calltip on hovering over a color value
* Open Color Chooser on double clicking on a color value

Usage
-----

*Document list*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This addon places a new item in the toolbar and when clicked offers a menu
listing all open files plus the 'Close All' and 'Close Other Documents' menu
items. This can be useful to quickly access open files and switch to them.

*Open and Copy URI*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adds 'Open URI' and 'Copy URI' menu items to the editor menu when the word under
the cursor looks like a URI. 'Open URI' uses the browser command configured in
Geany to open it.

*Tasks*
^^^^^^^
The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out lines with
configurable keywords (e.g. "TODO" or "FIXME") in them. It collects the text
after those words and puts them in a new "Tasks" tab in the message window.
Clicking on a task in that tab takes you to the line in the file where the
task was defined.

*Systray*
^^^^^^^^^
Adds a status icon to the notification area (systray) and provides
a simple popup menu with some basic actions. It can also be used to
quickly show and hide the Geany main window.

*Bookmark list*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Add a list of defined bookmarks (line markers) to the sidebar.
This list contains all bookmarks defined in the current file
for faster overview and access.

*Mark Word*
^^^^^^^^^^^
When double-clicking a word, all occurrences of this word are searched
and then highlighted (similar to Geany's 'Mark All' Find option).

*Strip trailing blank lines*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This addon removes excessive trailing blank lines from the document when it is
saved. If you have 'Ensure new line at file end' option checked in Preferences,
one trailing newline will be left.

*XML tagging*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
XML tagging allows to easy tag a selected text, by checking for a
selection, offering a little dialog for inserting a tag and
replacing a selection.

*Enclosing selected text*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Provides two methods for enclosing selected text in characters.  If the 'Enclose
selection automatically' option is checked in Preferences, selected text will
be surrounded when certain characters are pressed (e.g. highlight a string and
press ", the string will be surrounded in double quotes).  Also allows you to
define up to eight of your own opening and closing character pairs, which can
then be linked to a keybinding (e.g. set [ and ] to be Enclose Pair 1 and the
keybinding to ctrl+[ , highlight some text and press ctrl+[ to surround the
selected text in brackets).

*Copy File Path*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Simple extension to easily copy the full path of the current file
to the clipboard for further use.
The action can be triggered by a keyboard shortcut as well as by
a menu item in the Tools menu.

*Show colorized calltip on hovering over a color value*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This extension will show a calltip if the mouse is hovered over a color
value like #fff or #ffffff. The calltip background color represents the
color value over which the mouse is hovered. The preferences option "Show
a calltip when hovering over a color value" is used to enable or disable
the extension.

*Open Color Chooser on double clicking on a color value*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This extension will open the Color Chooser if the user double clicks on
a color value like #fff or #ffffff. The preferences option "Open Color
Chooser when double-clicking a color value" is used to enable or disable
the extension.

Requirements
------------

* GTK >= 2.8.0
* Geany >= 0.21
