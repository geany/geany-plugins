About
-----

Tableconvert is a plugin which helps on converting a tabulator
separated selection into a table.


Installation
------------

This version of the plugin is installed with the combined
geany-plugins release. Please check README of this package


Usage
-----

After the plugins has been installed successfully, load the plugin
via Geany's plugin manager. This will add a new keybinding into
Geany's list of keybindings inside the preferences dialog. You might
like to set up a keybinding for the function. Once this is done, the
plugin is ready to use.

When using the plugin, just mark the area you like to transform and
push your keybinding. All line endings will be taken as end of a row
and therefor transformed to fitting row endings.

Currently the plugin is supporting HTML and LaTeX.


HTML
^^^^

When transforming HTML, line endings will be replace with <tr> and
</tr>. Occurrences of tabulator will be interpreted as column
separators and replaced by <td> and </td>.

The first line will be treaded as header and surrounded by
<thead></thead> tags. The rest of the table will be included into
<tbody></tbody>.


LaTeX
^^^^^

In case of working with LaTeX line endings will be replaced with \\
and tabulators with &.

Rectangle selections are currently not supported and might lead to
some weird output you didn't expect -- just don't try it if you have
heart issues or working on an important document :)

Development
-----------

You can checkout the current source code from the Subversion repository at
Sourceforge.net. Get the code from:

Known issues
------------

The plugin currently is not supporting rectangle selections very
well. Also it is not able to support <thead> and <tbody> at the
moment. However, at least the second point is planned for some later
release.
