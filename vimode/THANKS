Various parts of the plugin code were taken from other Geany plugins, from Geany
code or Scintilla. Thanks to all the authors of the corresponding code.

Thanks to Frank Lanitz for the name of the plugin.

Thanks to Bill Joy and Bram Moolenaar for creating vi and vim, respectively, so
every bloody editor on the planet has to create a compatibility mode with this
crazy editor to make users happy.
