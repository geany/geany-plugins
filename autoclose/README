About
-----

This plugin enables auto-closing features. Auto-closing works while you typing 
and intellectually helps you to write code.

Features
--------

* auto-close for: { }, [ ], ( ), " ", ' ', < >, ` `
* customizeable auto-closing inside strings and comments
* delete pairing character if you pressed BackSpace
* suppress inserting one char twice (if you type "{}" you will get "{}", not
  "{}}")
* enclose selected text into brackets instead of removing selection (select
  text and type "(" or ")" to enclose selection into "()")
* keep selection when enclosing
* for C-like languages enclosing selection into "{}" makes auto-indentation
  (select text and type "{" or "}" - text will be enclosed and indented)
* enclosing in {} moves cursor to beginning (before "{" character)
* for C-like languages to insert {}-block you do not need to select text
  precisely: plugin detects boundaries automatically, just ensure that selection
  covers lines you need to indent (works like TAB indentation)
* fix auto-indent inside {} (makes full indent for this block)
* auto-close curly bracket by pressing Enter
* auto-close functions (``"sin(|" -> "sin(|);"``) with doubling suppression
  (for C/C++ languages only)
* remove paring brace when pressing Shift+BackSpace, unindent {}-blocks
* add semicolon after ``struct {|};`` and ``class {|};``
* move cursor to closed char by pressing Tab
