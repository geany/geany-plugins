Operation Details
=================

Remove Duplicate Lines
----------------------

The first occurrence of each duplicate line will remain in the file. 
The **Sorted** option will sort the file and remove duplicate lines 
[fast on large files]. The **Ordered** option will keep the same order 
of lines [slow on large files].

  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines. (#comments added for
  clarity)

  ::

    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 2    #removed
    Line 3
    Line 1    #removed
    Line 2    #removed

  The **Remove Duplicate Lines, sorted** will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3

  The **Remove Duplicate Lines, ordered** will change the file into 
  this:

  ::

    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 3



Remove Unique Lines
-------------------

Removes all lines that appear only once.

  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines. (#comments added for 
  clarity)

  ::

    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3    #removed
    Line 1
    Line 2

  The **Remove Unique Lines** will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 2

Remove Empty Lines
------------------

Removes all lines that only contain a newline character, and no other 
characters.

  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines. (#comments, and 
  \\n newline characters added for clarity)

  ::

    Line 2\n
    Line 1\n
    \n          #removed
         \n     #NOT removed (contains spaces)
        Line 1\n
    Line 2\n

  The **Remove Empty Lines** will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 2\n
    Line 1\n
         \n
        Line 1\n
    Line 2\n


Remove Whitespace Lines
-----------------------

Removes all lines that have only whitespace characters.


  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines. (#comments, and \\n
  newline characters added for clarity)

  ::

    Line 2\n
    Line 1\n
    \n           #removed
         \n      #removed (contains only whitespace chars)
     \t \n       #removed (contains only whitespace chars)
        Line 1\n #NOT removed (contains non whitespace chars)
    Line 2\n

  The **Remove Whitespace Lines** will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 2\n
    Line 1\n
        Line 1\n
    Line 2\n

Sort Lines
----------

Sorts lines ascending or descending based on ASCII values 
(lexicographic sort).


  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines.

  ::

    line 1
    line 2
    line
    line 3
    line

  The **Sort Lines Ascending** will change the file into this:

  ::

    line
    line
    line 1
    line 2
    line 3


  The **Sort Lines Descending** will change the file into this:

  ::

    line 3
    line 2
    line 1
    line
    line
