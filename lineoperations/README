About
=====

Line Operations is an assortment of simple line functions that can be 
applied to an open file, or selection.

Features
========

* Remove Duplicate Lines, sorted
* Remove Duplicate Lines, ordered
* Remove Unique Lines
* Keep Unique Lines
* Remove Empty Lines
* Remove Whitespace Lines
* Remove Every Nth Line
* Sort Lines Ascending
* Sort Lines Descending

Usage
=====

After the plugins has been installed successfully, load the plugin via 
Geany's plugin manager and a new menu item in the Tools menu will 
appear. Click on each menu item to apply the operation on whole file, or 
selection. See descriptions below to see operations for each menu item.

Selection
---------

If a selection is made in the file, the line operation will be applied to the 
lines within the selection. The beginning of the selection will expand to the 
beginning of its line, and the end of the selection will expand to the end of 
its line. If the end of the selection is on col 0, that line will be included.

Notes
-----

 * Line Operations will **not** make changes to a file until you save 
   the file.


Operation Details
=================

Remove Duplicate Lines
----------------------

The first occurrence of each duplicate line will remain in the file. 
The **Sorted** option will sort the file and remove duplicate lines 
[fast on large files]. The **Ordered** option will keep the same order 
of lines [slow on large files].

  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines. (#comments added for
  clarity)

  ::

    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 2    #removed
    Line 3
    Line 1    #removed
    Line 2    #removed

  The **Remove Duplicate Lines, sorted** will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3

  The **Remove Duplicate Lines, ordered** will change the file into 
  this:

  ::

    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 3



Remove Unique Lines
-------------------

Removes all lines that appear only once.

  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines. (#comments added for 
  clarity)

  ::

    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3    #removed
    Line 1
    Line 2

  The **Remove Unique Lines** will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 1
    Line 2


Keep Unique Lines
-------------------

Keep all lines that appear only once.

  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines. (#comments added for 
  clarity)

  ::

    Line 4
    Line 1    #removed
    Line 2    #removed
    Line 3
    Line 1    #removed
    Line 2    #removed

  The **Keep Unique Lines** will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 4
    Line 3


Remove Empty Lines
------------------

Removes all lines that only contain a newline character, and no other 
characters.

  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines. (#comments, and 
  \\n newline characters added for clarity)

  ::

    Line 2\n
    Line 1\n
    \n          #removed
         \n     #NOT removed (contains spaces)
        Line 1\n
    Line 2\n

  The **Remove Empty Lines** will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 2\n
    Line 1\n
         \n
        Line 1\n
    Line 2\n


Remove Whitespace Lines
-----------------------

Removes all lines that have only whitespace characters.


  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines. (#comments, and \\n
  newline characters added for clarity)

  ::

    Line 2\n
    Line 1\n
    \n           #removed
         \n      #removed (contains only whitespace chars)
     \t \n       #removed (contains only whitespace chars)
        Line 1\n #NOT removed (contains non whitespace chars)
    Line 2\n

  The **Remove Whitespace Lines** will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 2\n
    Line 1\n
        Line 1\n
    Line 2\n

Remove Every Nth Line
---------------------

The user can enter a number N. Every Nth line will be removed then.

  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines and the user enters the
  value 2 for N. (#comments added for clarity)

  ::

    Line 1
    Line 2    #removed
    Line 3
    Line 4    #removed
    Line 5

  The **Remove Every Nth Line** (N=2) will change the file into this:

  ::

    Line 1
    Line 3
    Line 5

Sort Lines
----------

Sorts lines ascending or descending based on ASCII values 
(lexicographic sort).


  Example: Suppose a file has the following lines.

  ::

    line 1
    line 2
    line
    line 3
    line

  The **Sort Lines Ascending** will change the file into this:

  ::

    line
    line
    line 1
    line 2
    line 3


  The **Sort Lines Descending** will change the file into this:

  ::

    line 3
    line 2
    line 1
    line
    line
