About
=====

LSP Client is a language server protocol client plugin that allows to run multiple
language servers for various programming languages, making their functionality
accessible to Geany.

Configuration
=============

The plugin does not come bundled with any language server; these must
be installed independently of the plugin. For installation and configuration
instructions, please refer to the documentation of the specific servers you plan
to use, as some may have specific requirements. Note that many language servers,
such as ``clangd``, ``pylsp``, and ``gopls``, are often packaged by Linux
distributions, making them easy to install and use.

You can configure servers and other settings using the User configuration file,
accessible from::

    Tools->LSP Client->User configuration

This file provides extensive information about all the settings options, so be
sure to refer to it for more details. The default configuration file comes with
pre-configured values for several language servers; other servers have to be
added manually.

By default, the LSP plugin is disabled unless explicitly enabled for a
project under

::

    Project->Properties->LSP Client

This behavior can be controlled by the first three configuration options in
the ``[all]`` section of the configuration file.

Language servers are started lazily, meaning they only launch when you switch
a tab to a file with a filetype that has a corresponding LSP server configured.
After the initial handshake between the client and server, you can check the
result under 

::

    Tools->LSP Client->Server Initialize Responses

This file also provides information about the capabilities offered by the server;
for more details, refer to:

https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/

In addition to the User configuration file, you can also create a per-project
configuration file (which can also be shared by multiple projects). This file
can be configured under the

::

    Project->Properties->LSP Client

tab.

Furthermore, the plugin offers a range of customizable keybindings, which can be
configured from::

    Edit->Preferences->Keybindings->LSP Client

Usage
=====

This section provides an overview of the individual LSP features supported by
the plugin, along with guidance on how to use them. You can enable or disable
each feature in the configuration file, where you can also customize certain
aspects of their behavior.

Please note that not all language servers support every feature. For more
information on the specific features supported by a language server, consult
the server's documentation.

Autocompletion
--------------

Autocompletion works similarly to Geany's autocompletion feature. You can
configure keybindings triggering the autocompletion popup.

Function signagure
------------------

When you type an open brace after a function name, the plugin displays the
function's signature in a popup window similarly to Geany's behavior.

Diagnostic messages
-------------------

LSP diagnostic messages typically include error messages or warnings from
compilers, as well as messages from linters. These messages are highlighted in
the code; the exact style of highlighting can be configured to suit your
preferences. When you hover over the highlighted part with your mouse cursor,
a popup window appears, providing additional details about the issue. It is
also possible to display all diagnostic messages received from the server in
the message window.

Code actions
------------

Some servers offer auto-fixes of certain issues or various refactoring options.
For instance, the ``clangd`` server displays ``fix available`` next to the issue
in the hover popup window. To perform the auto-fix, right-click the line with
the issue and select the corresponding option from the Commands submenu. This
popup can also be invoked by a keybinding.

Code lenses
-----------

Code lenses are executable commands that are specific to a particular piece of
code. As Geany's Scintilla component limitations prevent these commands
from being clickable and executable directly in the editor, they are accessible
through the Commands submenu of the context menu, similarly to code actions.

Semantic token type highlighting
--------------------------------

Language servers that provide semantic token support can be used to highlight
types, such as class names, in the code. You can customize various aspects of
how the results are visualized in the editor through the configuration file.

Hover popup
-----------

The language server can be configured to display a popup window with detailed
information about the symbol under the mouse cursor. However, as this feature
can be slightly annoying, it is disabled by default. Alternatively, you can
access this feature through a keybinding.

Symbol tree
-----------

The LSP symbol tree tab in the sidebar, separate from Geany's Symbols tab,
shows document symbols in a similar manner to the Geany's symbol tree feature.

Go to symbol definition/declaration
-----------------------------------

Similarly to Geany, you can navigate to the symbol definition/declaration
by control-clicking it in the document or by using the corresponding keybinding.
This feature is also available from the context menu.

Go to type definition
---------------------

This feature enables quick navigation to the definition of the type associated
with the symbol under the cursor, such as the type of a variable. You can also
access this feature from the context menu.

Swap header/source
------------------

This is a non-standard clangd extension allowing quick swapping between a
source file and the corresponding header. This feature is not supported by
any other language server.

Find references
---------------

This feature finds all references of the symbol under the cursor in the project.
This feature is also accessible from the context menu.

Find implementations
--------------------

This feature allows you to locate all classes that implement the interface under
the cursor.

Navigation to document/project symbols, files, and line numbers
---------------------------------------------------------------

The plugin provides a simple, VSCode-style panel for navigating your project.
The

::

    Tools->LSP Client->Go to Anywhere

command offers four types of navigation options:

- Open files by typing their name directly in the entry
- Navigate to symbols in the current document by prefixing the query with ``@``
- Navigate to symbols across the entire project by prefixing the query with ``#``
- Jump to a specific line in the current document by prefixing the query with ``:``

The other related queries in the LSP Client menu (also accessible via a keybinding)
simply pre-fill the prefix for you, but otherwise function identically.

Code formatting
---------------

The code formatting feature allows you to format either the entire document or
a selected portion of code, depending on the LSP server's support for this
functionality. You can access this feature from the context menu.

Identical symbol highlighting
-----------------------------

When you click on a symbol in the document, this feature highlights all its
occurrences in the document. You can customize the highlighting style to your
preference by configuring it in the configuration file. Also, it is possible
to disable this feature to be performed automatically, but, instead, manually
through a keybinding.

Smart selection expanding/shrinking
-----------------------------------

This feature allows to expand the current text selection to contain the next
upper syntactic element such as a parent block in programming languages or a
parent tag in XML. Selection shrinking works in the opposite direction.

Document symbol renaming
------------------------

This feature leverages the identical symbol highlighting described above to
select all symbol occurrences, create multiple cursors at their positions in the
document, and rename them simultaneously as you type. You can also access this
feature from the context menu.

Project-wide renaming
---------------------

After selecting Rename in Project from the context menu or the plugin menu,
you can rename all symbols in the project.

**Warning:** This feature has a potential to modify many files and language
servers may not be completely reliable when performing the rename so be very
cautious when using it. The plugin does not perform any additional
checks and does not show any preview of the changes so it is best to use this
feature only after committing all modified files so you can
easily revert to a working state if needed. Since this is potentially a
dangerous operation, to prevent accidental renames, the "Rename" button in the
dialog is not selected by defalut and simply pressing enter just cancels the
dialog.

Limitations
===========

By design, the plugin communicates over stdin/stdout only, is responsible
for launching and terminating the language server process, and supports only
a single language server per file type.

All of these limitations are addressed by the LSP proxy project available at
https://github.com/techee/lsp-proxy and related issues should be directed there.
