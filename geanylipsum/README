About
------

GeanyLipsum is a plugin for Geany that implements a Lorem Ipsum
generator to insert placeholder text into your document.


Installation
------------

This version of the plugin is installed with the combined
geany-plugins release. Please check README of this package


Usage
-----

After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear.

To insert Lorem Ipsum to your document, either use the appearing menu
item or use the keystroke which you can configure inside Geany's
preferences dialog. Inside the dialog you can set up a length of the
text. Values between 1 and 5000 chars are available here. If you
choose a length that is not fitting with the length of the Lipsum
snippet shipped with this plugin it will be repeated and cut so you
will always get the wished number of chars inserted.

You can checkout the current source code from the Subversion repository at
Sourceforge.net. Get the code from:
