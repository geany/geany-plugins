About
=====

WebHelper is a plugin for Geany that provides some web development facilities,
such as a web page preview and some debugging tools (web inspector).


Prominent features
------------------

* A basic web view, allowing to display any web page (using WebKit);
* Possible automatic reloading of the web view upon document saving;
* A web inspector/debugging tool for the web view's content (including a
  JavaScript console, a viewer and editor of processed HTML and CSS, a network
  usage analysis tool and many more, thanks to WebKit);
* Basic bookmarks for quicker access to frequently used URL.


Requirements
============

This plugin requires GTK3, GLib (>= 2.38), GIO (>= 2.30), GdkPixbuf,
WebKit2GTK (either API 4.0 or 4.1), and obviously Geany (>= 1.25) to work.
If you intend to build it yourself, you will need to get the development
files of these libraries. You can find these packages at http://www.geany.org/,
http://www.gtk.org/ and http://www.webkitgtk.org/.


Installation
============

For detailed instructions, see the INSTALL file of the Geany-Plugins package
this plugin is part of.


Usage
=====

When loaded into Geany, this plugins adds a web view in the message window
(the default), the sidebar or in a separate window. You can find most of the
features from this view.

The web view displays the URL chosen in the address bar.  This can be any valid
URL that would work in a web browser, for example it could be a local web
server like ``http://localhost/test/index.php``, a local file like
``file:///home/user/projects/test/index.html``, or a remote website like
``https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/``.

In addition to a rendered preview, the main feature is the inspector.  To
inspect the displayed page, either open the inspector using the toolbar item on
the far end of the address bar, or right click on any element of the page and
select *Inspect Element*.  For more documentation on the inspector's features,
see https://webkit.org/web-inspector/.

Bookmarks
---------

To add a bookmark, you can click on the website's icon next to its URL and
check the "Bookmark this website" item.  You can alternatively use the
configurable keybinding to toggle the bookmark for the current URL.

Bookmarks are displayed in the drop-down menu of the URL bar, sorted
alphabetically by domain.
