About
=====

NumConvert is a plugin that hopefully simplifies dealing with numbers,
by converting selected numbers into other formats and more complex
representations via a convinient right-click menu. 


Requirements
============

NumConvert is written in Vala and so requires that you have the Vala
compiler (valac) installed as well as your existing C compiler. There
is no other requirement that isn't already required to build Geany.

Installation
============

For detailed instructions, see the INSTALL file of the Geany-Plugins package
this plugin is part of.

Usage
=====

Select a number (e.g. 50) in the source code. Then right-click on it to open
the editor menu. Navigate to the "Convert number" entry which will open
a sub menu which offers various replacement representations of the same number.

The first submenu is shortened and may specific to the filetype of the currently
opened file. All possible replacements are available through the "All" submenu.
