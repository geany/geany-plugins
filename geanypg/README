GeanyPG
-------

About
------

GeanyPG is a plugin for Geany that allows the user to encrypt, decrypt
and verify signatures with GnuPG.

Usage
-----

After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear.

If any text is selected, only the selected text will be encrypted/
signed/decrypted. When encrypting a message you can choose to sign at
the same time.
If a passphrase is needed, the GPGME library will decide how the user
is prompted. Usually this will use gpg-agent. If gpg-agent is disabled,
pinentry (see man 1 pinentry) will be used.

Development
-----------

You can checkout the current source code from the Subversion repository
at Sourceforge.net. Get the code from:

svn checkout
http://geany-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geany-plugins/trunk/geany-plugins/geanypg

If you want to create a patch, please respect the license of GeanyPG as
well as intellectual property of third parties. Patches that should be
included to the default distribution must be licensed under the same
conditions as GeanyPG by the copyright owner (GPL2+).


Known issues
------------

At the moment, the use of pinentry is only supported on unix-like
systems. On Windows gpg-agent has to be used.
