GeanyPG
-------

About
------

GeanyPG is a plugin for Geany that allows the user to encrypt, decrypt
and verify signatures with GnuPG.

Usage
-----

After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear.

If any text is selected, only the selected text will be encrypted/
signed/decrypted. When encrypting a message you can choose to sign at
the same time.
If a passphrase is needed, the GPGME library will decide how the user
is prompted. Usually this will use gpg-agent. If gpg-agent is disabled,
pinentry (see man 1 pinentry) will be used.

Development
-----------

You can checkout the current source code from the git repository at
github.com. Get the code by:

Known issues

At the moment, the use of pinentry is only supported on unix-like
systems. On Windows gpg-agent has to be used.
